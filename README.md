# bootstrapproject
This is my bootstrap project for my Web 225 class. The goal of this project was to show 
that the class knew how to use Boostrap 3 in building a website. The form that is in this project
did not need to work so, I did not add a php page to the project.
The grade that I received for this project was an A.
